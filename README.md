# Ecommerce recommendation system design using Python on Amazon & Home Depot's dataset


A well developed recommendation system will help businesses improve their shopper's experience on website and result in better customer acquisition and retention.

The recommendation system, I have designed is based on the journey of a new customer from the time he/she lands on the businessâ€™s website for the first time to when he/she makes repeat purchases. 

This works best if a business is setting up its e-commerce website for the first time and does not have user-item purchase/rating history to start with initally. This recommendation system will help the users get a good recommendation to start with and once the buyers have a purchased history, the recommendation engine can use the model based collaborative filtering technique.
